# [Suspense Example](https://github.com/crimx/observable-hooks/tree/master/examples/suspense)

This project is based on the [Render-as-You-Fetch](https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-suspense.html#approach-3-render-as-you-fetch-using-suspense) example on React Docs. It shows the ability of using observable-hooks with React Suspense.

[Having a stream of React elements](https://observable-hooks.js.org/examples/#conditional-rendering-vanilla-javascript) is also equally powerful as you can manipulate with all the RxJS goodies.

Also see the [Render-as-You-Fetch]() guide with Observables.
